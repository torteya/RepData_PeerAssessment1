## Carlos Martinez-Torteya | December 2014
This repository contains the files required for Peer Review of Project 1.

The files in this repository are:
- PA1_template.Rmd R markdown source file. Created using R Studio on OSX Yosemite
- PA1_template.md markdown file generated using knit2html() in R v3.1.1
- PA1_template.html html file generated using knit2html() in R v3.1.1
- figure directory generated by knit2htm() in R v3.1.1

**Note that only "PA1_template.md" will display correctly within GitHub, as html files
are displayed as code files.**
